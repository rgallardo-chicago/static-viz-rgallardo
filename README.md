# The impacts of car dependency in Chicago: an analysis of traffic crash data in Chicago

## Description
The 2023 CDOT report notes a 27% decrease in traffic fatalities from 2021; however, injury-related crashes show persistent issues. Analysis of 2018–2023 data reveals a lack of improvement in injury reduction within high-risk neighborhoods, notably Austin, Humboldt Park, Garfield Park, and Englewood, while the Loop improved. South side neighborhoods saw increases in injury crashes, contrasting with decreases in many north side areas. Additionally, injury rates per 1,000 people rose across most age groups, with notable increases for pedestrians and cyclists aged 21-40. The rising prevalence of SUVs—accounting for 46% of crashes with injuries by 2024—correlates with higher injury severity and increased crash costs, as 71% of crashes now exceed $1,500 in damages.

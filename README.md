## Description

The U.S. is known for it's car-dependent culture, but unfortunately is has taken a turn for the worst. 
According to recently published [NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/26/1184034017/us-pedestrian-deaths-high-traffic-car), pedestrian deaths from vehicle are at a 40-year high. This is likely attributed to the increase in vehicle size, which has made collisions with vehicles even more deadly ([source](https://www.economist.com/interactive/united-states/2024/08/31/americans-love-affair-with-big-cars-is-killing-them)). In addition, the disinvestment in public transit services continues accross the country, which doesn't help combat the dependency on cars. For instance, even in big cities like Chicago, public transit services struggle to provide the same level of service before the pandemic. 

The goal of this project is to analyze the impact of the "big car" trend and the disinvestment in public transit in the city of Chicago through a series of data visuals. The project will consist of visuals that will hopefully capture how these trends have materialized throughout Chicago.

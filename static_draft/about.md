# Car Dependency in Chicago Keeps Getting Worse

Ruben Gallardo

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?
My goal is to show that car dependency in Chicago has worsened. As proof I want to show that more people are getting injured or killed on the roads as a result of this and that bigger cars are causing more damage to people’s lives. My goal has slightly changed since my proposal since I originally also wanted to look at CTA data. The traffic crashes datasets from the City of Chicago data portal are quite extensive, so I didn’t want to add more to the scope of the project since it would sacrifice the amount of detail that I am able to include just on what cars are doing to people in the city.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?
Yes, the vehicle dataset is a little messy. For example, I noticed that the Ford F150 car model is categorized as a passenger vehicle, SUV, pickup, van, and other in the dataset. This messy vehicle_type column is getting in the way of showing better and more compelling visuals, but I have a plan to clean up the data. I will rely on datasets like this one: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/peshimaammuzammil/2023-car-model-dataset-all-data-you-need to help me clean the data.

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal.
See Jupyter notebook.

## What form do you envision your final deliverable taking? (An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)
I want this to be a data journalism article. I want to pitch it to a couple independent publications in Chicago like South Side Weekly. If it’s not picked up by any local publications, I plan to self-publish it.
